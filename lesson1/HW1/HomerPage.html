<p><b>Biography:</b></p>
<p>Homer Jay Simpson was born on May 12, 1956 to Abraham Simpson II and Mona Olsen. He was raised on the Simpson family farm until they were forced to move out due to Homer jumping out of a hay bale and scaring the cows into giving sour milk, causing the bank to foreclose it. At some point in his childhood, Homer began drinking alcohol like his father and accidentally caused a traffic jam in a Playskool car.</p>
